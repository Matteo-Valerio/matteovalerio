<h1> Biography </h1>

<p>
I have been working in the field of Medical Informatics since 2011, when I started working on information systems and technologies for managing health data, developing applications for the collection and statistical analysis of clinical data, mainly in the oncology field.
</p>

<p>
Since 2012, I have been working steadily in the Department of Oncology at the IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital, where my activity has evolved over time thanks to the knowledge acquired through academic courses and certifications that have allowed me to connect multidisciplinary skills useful for forming my background in data science. 
</p>

<p>
Currently, my activity involves managing clinical data related to the oncology field, aggregating the various sources of information that characterize its interdisciplinary nature and developing software applications for their analysis. 
</p>

<p>
In the field of clinical research, I am responsible for creating electronic CRFs for data collection and conducting statistical analysis related to the definition of regression models, survival analysis, and the application of clustering and classification techniques in order to identify relationships between data. 
</p>

<p>
My passion and curiosity for new technologies related to data science drives me to stay updated, especially in the area of Artificial Intelligence applied to clinical research. 
</p>

<p>
For the Oncology Department, I also manage several software applications useful for medical and nursing clinical activities.
