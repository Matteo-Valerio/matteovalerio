abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and alcohol abuse are the main risk
  factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Western countries. AIM: To investigate
  the role of alcoholic aetiology on clinical presentation, treatment and outcome
  of HCC as well as on each Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage, as compared
  to HCV-related HCCs. METHODS: A total of 1642 HCV and 573 alcoholic patients from
  the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) database, diagnosed with HCC between January
  2000 and December 2012 were compared for age, gender, type of diagnosis, tumour
  burden, portal vein thrombosis (PVT), oesophageal varices, liver function tests,
  alpha-fetoprotein, BCLC, treatment and survival. Aetiology was tested as predictor
  of survival in multivariate Cox regression models and according to HCC stages. RESULTS:
  Cirrhosis was present in 96% of cases in both groups. Alcoholic patients were younger,
  more likely male, with HCC diagnosed outside surveillance, in intermediate/terminal
  BCLC stage and had worse liver function. After adjustment for the lead-time, median
  (95% CI) overall survival (OS) was 27.4 months (21.5-33.2) in alcoholic and 33.6
  months (30.7-36.5) in HCV patients (P = 0.021). The prognostic role of aetiology
  disappeared when survival was assessed in each BCLC stage and in the Cox regression
  multivariate models. CONCLUSIONS: Alcoholic aetiology affects survival of HCC patients
  through its negative effects on secondary prevention and cancer presentation but
  not through a greater cancer aggressiveness or worse treatment result. In fact,
  survival adjusted for confounding factors was similar in alcoholic and HCV patients.'
