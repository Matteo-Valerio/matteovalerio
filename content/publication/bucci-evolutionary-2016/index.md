abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma is changing
  worldwide. This study aimed at evaluating the changing scenario of aetiology, presentation,
  management and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma in Italy during the last 15 years.
  METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the ITA.LI.CA (Italian Liver Cancer) database
  including 5192 hepatocellular carcinoma patients managed in 24 centres from 2000
  to 2014. Patients were divided into three groups according to the date of cancer
  diagnosis (2000-2004, 2005-2009 and 2010-2014). RESULTS: The main results were as
  follows: (i) progressive patient aging; (ii) progressive expansion of non-viral
  cases and, namely, of \"metabolic\" hepatocellular carcinomas; (iii) increasing
  proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed during a correct (semi-annual)
  surveillance programme; (iv) favourable cancer stage migration; (v) increased use
  of radiofrequency ablation to the detriment of percutaneous ethanol injection; (vi)
  improved outcomes of ablative and transarterial treatments; (vii) improved overall
  survival (adjusted for the lead time in surveyed patients), particularly after 2009,
  of both viral and non-viral patients presenting with an early- or intermediate-stage
  hepatocellular carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: During the last 15 years several aetiological
  and clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma patients have changed, as their
  management. The observed improvement of overall survival was owing both to the wider
  use of semi-annual surveillance, expanding the proportion of tumours that qualified
  for curative treatments, and to the improved outcome of loco-regional treatments.'
