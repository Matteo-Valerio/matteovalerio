abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Assessment of long-term outcome is required in hepatitis
  C virus (HCV)-infected patients with cirrhosis, who have been successfully treated
  for Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
  However, problems arise due to the lack of models accounting for early changes during
  follow-up. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of early events (HCC
  recurrence or hepatic decompensation within 12months of complete radiological response)
  on 5-year overall survival (OS) in a large cohort of patients with HCV and cirrhosis,
  successfully treated HCC. METHODS: A total of 328 consecutive Caucasian patients
  with HCV-related cirrhosis and BCLC stage 0/A HCC who had complete radiological
  response after curative resection or thermal ablation were prospectively recruited
  to this study. Primary endpoint of the study was 5-year OS. Independent baseline
  and time-dependent predictors of 5-year OS were identified by Cox model. RESULTS:
  The observed 5-year survival rate was 44%. The observed HCC early recurrence and
  early hepatic decompensation rate were 21% and 10%, respectively. Early hepatic
  decompensation (Hazard Ratio [HR] 7.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.23-13.48)
  and HCC early recurrence as time-dependent covariates (HR 2.50; 95%CI: 1.23-5.05),
  presence of esophageal varices at baseline (HR 1.66; 95% CI: 1.02-2.70) and age
  (HR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02-1.07) were significantly associated with the 5-year OS. CONCLUSION:
  Survival in HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis and successfully treated HCC is
  influenced by early hepatic decompensation. Our study indirectly suggests that direct-acting
  antiviral agents could improve OS of HCC patients through long-term preservation
  of liver function, resulting in a lower cirrhosis-related mortality and a greater
  change of receiving curative treatments. LAY SUMMARY: Survival in hepatitis C virus
  (HCV) infected patients with cirrhosis and successfully treated hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC), is mainly influenced by early hepatic decompensation. HCV eradication after
  treatment with new direct-acting antiviral agents could improve overall survival
  of HCC patients through long-term preservation of liver function.'
