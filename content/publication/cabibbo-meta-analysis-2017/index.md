abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Determining risk for recurrence or survival after curative
  resection or ablation in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC) is important for stratifying patients according to expected outcomes
  in future studies of adjuvant therapy in the era of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).
  The aims of this meta-analysis were to estimate the recurrence and survival probabilities
  of HCV-related early HCC following complete response after potentially curative
  treatment and to identify predictors of recurrence and survival. METHODS: Studies
  reporting time-dependent outcomes (HCC recurrence or death) after potentially curative
  treatment of HCV-related early HCC were identified in MEDLINE through May 2016.
  Data on patient populations and outcomes were extracted from each study by three
  independent observers and combined using a distribution-free summary survival curve.
  Primary outcomes were actuarial probabilities of recurrence and survival. RESULTS:
  Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Pooled estimates of actuarial recurrence
  rates were 7.4% at 6 months and 47.0% at 2 years. Pooled estimates of actuarial
  survival rates were 79.8% at 3 years and 58.6% at 5 years. Heterogeneity among studies
  was highly significant for all outcomes. By univariate meta-regression analyses,
  lower serum albumin, randomized controlled trial study design and follow-up were
  independently associated with higher recurrence risk, whereas tumour size and alpha-foetoprotein
  levels were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed
  that recurrence risk and survival are extremely variable in patients with successfully
  treated HCV-related HCC, providing a useful benchmark for indirect comparisons of
  the benefits of DAAs and for a correct design of randomized controlled trials in
  the adjuvant setting.'
