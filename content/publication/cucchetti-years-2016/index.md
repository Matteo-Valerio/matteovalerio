abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes premature death and loss
  of life expectancy worldwide. Its primary and secondary prevention can result in
  a significant number of years of life saved. AIM: To assess how many years of life
  are lost after HCC diagnosis. METHODS: Data from 5346 patients with first HCC diagnosis
  were used to estimate lifespan and number of years of life lost after tumour onset,
  using a semi-parametric extrapolation having as reference an age-, sex- and year-of-onset-matched
  population derived from national life tables. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2014, HCC
  lead to an average of 11.5 years-of-life lost for each patient. The youngest age-quartile
  group (18-61 years) had the highest number of years-of-life lost, representing approximately
  41% of the overall benefit obtainable from prevention. Advancements in HCC management
  have progressively reduced the number of years-of-life lost from 12.6 years in 1986-1999,
  to 10.7 in 2000-2006 and 7.4 years in 2007-2014. Currently, an HCC diagnosis when
  a single tumour textless2 cm results in 3.7 years-of-life lost while the diagnosis
  when a single tumour â‰¥ 2 cm or 2/3 nodules still within the Milan criteria, results
  in 5.0 years-of-life lost, representing the loss of only approximately 5.5% and
  7.2%, respectively, of the entire lifespan from birth. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatocellular
  carcinoma occurrence results in the loss of a considerable number of years-of-life,
  especially for younger patients. In recent years, the increased possibility of effectively
  treating this tumour has improved life expectancy, thus reducing years-of-life lost.'
