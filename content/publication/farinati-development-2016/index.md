abstract: "BACKGROUND: Prognostic assessment in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma\
  \ (HCC) remains controversial. Using the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) database\
  \ as a training set, we sought to develop and validate a new prognostic system for\
  \ patients with HCC. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prospective collected databases from\
  \ Italy (training cohort, n = 3,628; internal validation cohort, n = 1,555) and\
  \ Taiwan (external validation cohort, n = 2,651) were used to develop the ITA.LI.CA\
  \ prognostic system. We first defined ITA.LI.CA stages (0, A, B1, B2, B3, C) using\
  \ only tumor characteristics (largest tumor diameter, number of nodules, intra-\
  \ and extrahepatic macroscopic vascular invasion, extrahepatic metastases). A parametric\
  \ multivariable survival model was then used to calculate the relative prognostic\
  \ value of ITA.LI.CA tumor stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance\
  \ status, Child-Pugh score (CPS), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in predicting individual\
  \ survival. Based on the model results, an ITA.LI.CA integrated prognostic score\
  \ (from 0 to 13 points) was constructed, and its prognostic power compared with\
  \ that of other integrated systems (BCLC, HKLC, MESIAH, CLIP, JIS). Median follow-up\
  \ was 58 mo for Italian patients (interquartile range, 26-106 mo) and 39 mo for\
  \ Taiwanese patients (interquartile range, 12-61 mo). The ITA.LI.CA integrated prognostic\
  \ score showed optimal discrimination and calibration abilities in Italian patients.\
  \ Observed median survival in the training and internal validation sets was 57 and\
  \ 61 mo, respectively, in quartile 1 (ITA.LI.CA score â‰¤ 1), 43 and 38 mo in quartile\
  \ 2 (ITA.LI.CA score 2-3), 23 and 23 mo in quartile 3 (ITA.LI.CA score 4-5), and\
  \ 9 and 8 mo in quartile 4 (ITA.LI.CA score textgreater 5). Observed and predicted\
  \ median survival in the training and internal validation sets largely coincided.\
  \ Although observed and predicted survival estimations were significantly lower\
  \ (log-rank test, p textless 0.001) in Italian than in Taiwanese patients, the ITA.LI.CA\
  \ score maintained very high discrimination and calibration features also in the\
  \ external validation cohort. The concordance index (C index) of the ITA.LI.CA score\
  \ in the internal and external validation cohorts was 0.71 and 0.78, respectively.\
  \ The ITA.LI.CA score's prognostic ability was significantly better (p textless\
  \ 0.001) than that of BCLC stage (respective C indexes of 0.64 and 0.73), CLIP score\
  \ (0.68 and 0.75), JIS stage (0.67 and 0.70), MESIAH score (0.69 and 0.77), and\
  \ HKLC stage (0.68 and 0.75). The main limitations of this study are its retrospective\
  \ nature and the intrinsically significant differences between the Taiwanese and\
  \ Italian groups. CONCLUSIONS: The ITA.LI.CA prognostic system includes both a tumor\
  \ staging-stratifying patients with HCC into six main stages (0, A, B1, B2, B3,\
  \ and C)-and a prognostic score-integrating ITA.LI.CA tumor staging, CPS, ECOG performance\
  \ status, and AFP. The ITA.LI.CA prognostic system shows a strong ability to predict\
  \ individual survival in European and Asian populations."
