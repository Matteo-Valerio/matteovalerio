abstract: For many years microscopy has been considered the mainstay of the diagnosis
  of parasitic infections. In our laboratory, before the advent of molecular biology,
  the approach for the identification of parasitic infections in stools was the microscopic
  exam of three samples. Once we adopted molecular biology, a real-time PCR on one
  single sample was added to the classical coproparasitological exam of three samples.
  Given the high sensitivity of real-time PCR (Rt-PCR), we then decided to evaluate
  if a change of our routine was justified. In detail, we intended to assess if a
  much more practical routine, based on the analysis of a single fecal sample, was
  sufficiently sensitive to replace the routine described above. The new approach
  to be evaluated included, on the same and unique fecal sample, a classical coproparasitological
  exam plus Rt-PCR. The data obtained showed that the sensitivity of the new proposed
  approach remains very high, despite the reduction of coproparasitological exams
  from three to one, with the advantage of reducing costs and saving time, both for
  patients and for the laboratory.
