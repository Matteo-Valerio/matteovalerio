abstract: 'OBJECTIVES: The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) intermediate stage
  (BCLC B) includes a heterogeneous population of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
  (HCC). Recently, in order to facilitate treatment decisions, a panel of experts
  proposed to subclassify BCLC B patients. In this study, we aimed to assess the prognostic
  capability of the BCLC B stage reclassification in a large cohort of patients with
  untreated HCC managed by the Italian Liver Cancer Group. METHODS: We assessed the
  prognosis of 269 untreated HCC patients observed in the period 1987-2012 who were
  reclassified according to the proposed subclassification of the BCLC B stage from
  stage B1 to stage B4. We evaluated and compared the survival of the various substages.
  RESULTS: Median survival progressively decreased from stage B1 (n=65, 24.2%: 25
  months) through stages B2 (n=105, 39.0%: 16 months) and B3 (n=22, 8.2%: 9 months),
  to stage B4 (n=77, 28.6%: 5 months; Ptextless0.0001). Moreover, we observed a significantly
  different survival between contiguous stages (B1 vs. B2, P=0.0002; B2 vs. B3, Ptextless0.0001;
  B3 vs. B4, P=0.0219). In multivariate analysis, the BCLC B subclassification (Ptextless0.0001),
  MELD score (P=0.0013), and platelet count (P=0.0252) were independent predictors
  of survival. CONCLUSIONS: The subclassification of the intermediate-stage HCC predicts
  the prognosis of patients with untreated HCC. The prognostic figures identified
  in this study may be used as a benchmark to assess the efficacy of therapeutic intervention
  in the various BCLC B substages, whereas it remains to be established whether incorporation
  of the MELD score might improve the prognosis of treated patients.'
