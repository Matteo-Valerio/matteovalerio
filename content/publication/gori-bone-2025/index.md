abstract: "INTRODUCTION: Adequate information about patients with bone metastases\
  \ could increase adherence to treatment and reduce or delay skeletal and dental\
  \ complications. Limited data are available on patient awareness, the degree of\
  \ information received, and adherence to specific treatment for bone metastases.\
  \ METHODS: ROPI (Rete Oncologica Pazienti Italia) conducted an anonymous survey\
  \ from 1 February to 31 August 2022 among patients with bone metastases from solid\
  \ tumors to evaluate their level of information and adherence to specific treatments\
  \ and dental evaluations. Questionnaires were administered by oncologists or nurses\
  \ at participating cancer centers. RESULTS: Analysis of 351 questionnaires revealed\
  \ that 75% of patients felt \\\"fairly/well\\\" informed about bone metastases and\
  \ skeletal complications. The oncologists were the primary source of information.\
  \ More than 80% of patients reported undergoing specific treatment for bone metastases\
  \ (denosumab, 48%; zoledronic acid, 46%); 93% of patients received dental evaluations\
  \ before starting therapy (with dental complications in only 0.3% of patients) and\
  \ 78% received information about the importance of regular dental checkups. Vitamin D\
  \ and calcium supplements were taken by 83% of patients. Among patients with skeletal\
  \ complications (47% of patients), bone radiotherapy was the most frequent (94%).\
  \ CONCLUSIONS: Most patients stated that they had received information about bone\
  \ metastases, skeletal complications, and specific treatments. This could increase\
  \ awareness and adherence to treatment and potentially reduce or delay skeletal\
  \ and/or dental complications improving patients' quality of life and survival."
