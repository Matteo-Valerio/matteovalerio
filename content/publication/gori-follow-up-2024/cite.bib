 abstract = {In Italy, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women, with 55,900 new cases in 2023 (over 90% in the early stages). Due to the screening, early diagnosis and adjuvant treatment, these patients have a 5-years survival rate of 87% after the diagnosis.
There are 834,154 women in Italy with a previous diagnosis of breast cancer: most of these women require a follow-up.
The AIOM, ESMO and ASCO Guidelines recommend for early breast cancer (EBC) a clinical follow-up with only physical examination (and eliciting of symptoms) and an annual X-ray mammography, on the basis of the results of two randomized trials published in 1994 that showed no benefit in overall survival with intensive follow-up.
However, an Italian survey reported the application by 80% of oncologists of an intensive follow-up based on the individual patientâ€™s risk of recurrence. In fact, the oncologists believe that an early diagnosis of locoregional or distant recurrence may allow an early start of very effective therapies.
In this lack of up-to-date scientific data, many questions about follow-up remain unanswered and the few ongoing studies will provide results in several years.
Non-compliance with guideline recommendations leads to increased costs for the healthcare system. Furthermore, management varies widely from centre to centre with regard to guideline recommendations, resulting in inequalities between patients. For these reasons, the follow-up of breast cancer should be reconsidered.
In the absence of recent scientific evidence, a multidisciplinary group of breast cancer experts has initiated a Consensus on the follow-up of EBC according to the mini-Delphi methodology. The project will be completed by the end of 2024.},
