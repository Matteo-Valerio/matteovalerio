 abstract = {In this retrospective, multi-institutional study, we collected data of 154 HER2-positive breast cancer patients diagnosed with brain metastases from 2005 to 2014 with the aim to assess the impact of local and systemic treatments on the outcome. We report better survival for patients receiving surgery or stereotactic radiosurgery as local treatment and for those receiving HER2-targeted therapy as systemic treatment.},
