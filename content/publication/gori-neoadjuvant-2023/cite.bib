 abstract = {To evaluate the rate of early breast cancer (EBC) patients treated with neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAT) in Italy, criteria of patient selection and types of therapies delivered, an analysis of 1276 patients with stage I-II-III was conducted out of 1633 patients enrolled in the multicenter prospective observational BRIDE study. A total of 177 patients (13.9%) were treated with NAT and 1099 (85.9%) with surgery; in multivariate analysis, menopausal status, cT, cN, grade, HER2-positive and Triple negative (TN) subgroups were significantly associated with the decision to administer NAT. The type of NAT delivered was influenced by EBC subtype. NAT was administered to 53.2% of HER2+/HR-negative, 27.9% of HER2+/HR+, 7.1% of HER2-negative/HR+ and 30.3% of TN EBC patients. The pCR rates were similar to the ones reported in the literature: 74.2% in HER2+/HR-negative, 52.3% in HER2+/HR+, 17.2% in HER2-negative/HR+ and 37.9% in TN. In clinical practice, patient and tumor characteristics influenced oncologists in the decision to administer NAT in EBC and in the choice of the type of systemic therapy, according to ESMO and AIOM Guidelines. Currently, it is recommended always to evaluate the use of NAT in EBC, mainly in HER2+ and TN patients, considering that pCR is associated with significantly better survival of the patient and that effective therapies are now available for residual disease.},
