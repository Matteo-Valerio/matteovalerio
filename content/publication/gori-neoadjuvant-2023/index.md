abstract: 'To evaluate the rate of early breast cancer (EBC) patients treated with
  neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAT) in Italy, criteria of patient selection and types
  of therapies delivered, an analysis of 1276 patients with stage I-II-III was conducted
  out of 1633 patients enrolled in the multicenter prospective observational BRIDE
  study. A total of 177 patients (13.9%) were treated with NAT and 1099 (85.9%) with
  surgery; in multivariate analysis, menopausal status, cT, cN, grade, HER2-positive
  and Triple negative (TN) subgroups were significantly associated with the decision
  to administer NAT. The type of NAT delivered was influenced by EBC subtype. NAT
  was administered to 53.2% of HER2+/HR-negative, 27.9% of HER2+/HR+, 7.1% of HER2-negative/HR+
  and 30.3% of TN EBC patients. The pCR rates were similar to the ones reported in
  the literature: 74.2% in HER2+/HR-negative, 52.3% in HER2+/HR+, 17.2% in HER2-negative/HR+
  and 37.9% in TN. In clinical practice, patient and tumor characteristics influenced
  oncologists in the decision to administer NAT in EBC and in the choice of the type
  of systemic therapy, according to ESMO and AIOM Guidelines. Currently, it is recommended
  always to evaluate the use of NAT in EBC, mainly in HER2+ and TN patients, considering
  that pCR is associated with significantly better survival of the patient and that
  effective therapies are now available for residual disease.'
