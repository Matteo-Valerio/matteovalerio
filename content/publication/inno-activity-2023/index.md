abstract: In the CodeBreaK 100 phase 2 study, sotorasib was active for patients with
  metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring Kirsten rat sarcoma viral
  oncogene homologue (KRAS) p.G12C mutation. However, patients with untreated and/or
  active brain metastases were excluded from the trial, and the activity of sotorasib
  in the setting of brain metastases should be further investigated. Here we report
  the case of a KRAS p.G12C mutant NSCLC patient with three brain metastases, of whom
  one was untreated and the other two had progressed after radiotherapy with symptoms
  requiring steroids, that responded to sotorasib. Our report suggests that sotorasib
  may be active against untreated or progressive brain metastases, supporting further
  evaluation of sotorasib in this setting.
