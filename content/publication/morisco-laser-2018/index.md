abstract: 'Background: Limited therapies are available for large (≥40 mm) unresectable
  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, the standard treatment with transarterial
  chemoembolisation (TACE) is unsatisfactory with high recurrence rate and limited
  effect on survival. Laser Ablation (LA) has emerged as a relatively new technique
  characterized by high efficacy and good safety. This study is aimed to evaluate
  the efficacy of LA in comparison to TACE in patients with large HCC. Methods: Eighty-two
  patients with a single HCC nodule ≥40 mm (BCLC stage A or B) were enrolled in this
  case-control study. Forty-one patients were treated with LA and 41 patients were
  treated with TACE. Response to therapy was evaluated according to the mRECIST criteria.
  Survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier from the time of cancer diagnosis to death
  with values censored at the date of the last follow-up. Results: Twenty-six (63.4%)
  and 8 (19.5%) patients had a complete response after LA and TACE, respectively (p
  textless 0.001). Subsequently we stratified the HCCs in 3 categories according to
  the nodule size: 40-50 mm, 51-60 mm, and textgreater60 mm. LA resulted superior
  to TACE especially in nodules ranging between 51 and 60 mm in diameter, with a complete
  response rate post-LA and post-TACE of 75% and 14.3%, respectively (p = 0.0133).
  The 36 months cumulative survival rate in patients treated with LA and TACE was
  55.4% and 48.8%, respectively. The disease recurrence rates after LA and TACE were
  19.5% and 75.0%, respectively. Conclusions: LA is a more effective therapeutic option
  than TACE in patients with solitary large HCC.'
