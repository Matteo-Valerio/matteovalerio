abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Metabolic disorders are well known risk factors for HCC. Conversely,
  their impact on the natural history of HCC is not established. This study aimed
  at evaluating the impact of metabolic disorders on clinical features, treatment
  and survival of HCC patients regardless of its etiology. METHODS: We analyzed the
  ITA.LI.CA database regarding 839 HCC patients prospectively collected. The following
  metabolic features were analyzed: BMI, diabetes, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
  and hypertriglyceridemia. According to these features, patients were divided into
  3 groups: 0hyphen1, 2 and 3hyphen5 metabolic features. RESULTS: As compared with
  patients with 0hyphen1 metabolic features, patients with 3hyphen5 features showed
  lower percentage of HCC diagnosis on surveillance (pequal0.021), larger tumors (pequal0.038),
  better liver function (higher percentage of ChildhyphenPugh class A [pequal0.007]
  and MELDlt10 [pequal0.003]), higher percentage of metastasis (pequal0.024), and
  lower percentage of portal vein thrombosis (pequal0.010). The BCLC stage and treatment
  options were similar among the 3 groups, with the exception of a less frequent access
  to locohyphenregional therapies for BCLC stage B patients with 3hyphen5 features
  (pequal0.012). Overall survival and survival according to BCLC stage andsolor treatment
  did not significantly differ among the 3 groups. Only using a probabilistic sensitivity
  analysis, diabetic patients showed a lower survival (pequal0.046). MELD score, HCC
  morphology, nodule size, BCLC stage, portal vein thrombosis and metastasis were
  independent predictors of leadhyphentime adjusted survival. CONCLUSIONS: Our \"real
  world\" study suggests that metabolic disorders shapes the clinical presentation
  of HCC but do not seem to play a major role in setting patient survival. This article
