abstract: Malnutrition affects up to 75% of cancer patients and results from a combination
  of anorexia and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic and nutritional abnormalities
  in cancer patients can lead to cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized
  by involuntary loss of skeletal muscle mass, systemic inflammation and increased
  protein catabolism. Cancer cachexia negatively affects patients' outcomes, response
  to anticancer treatments, quality of life, and survival. However, risk of malnutrition,
  and cachexia are still under-recognized in cancer patients. The Prevalence of Malnutrition
  in Oncology (PreMiO) study revealed that 51% of patients already had nutritional
  deficiencies at their first medical oncology visit. Here, we report the results
  of the subsequent retrospective, observational NUTRItional status at first medical
  oncology visit ON Clinical Outcomes (NUTRIONCO) study, aimed at assessing the impact
  of baseline nutritional and non-nutritional variables collected in the PreMiO study
  on the clinical outcomes of the same patients followed up from August 2019 to October
  2021. We have highlighted a statistically significant association between baseline
  variables and patient death, rehospitalization, treatment toxicity, and disease
  progression at follow-up. We found a higher overall survival probability in the
  well-nourished general study population vs. malnourished patients (p textless 0.001).
  Of major interest is the fact that patient stratification revealed that malnutrition
  decreased survival probability in non-metastatic patients but not in metastatic
  patients (p textless 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that baseline malnutrition
  (p = 0.004) and VAS score for appetite loss (p = 0.0104), in addition to albumin
  textless 35 g/L (p textless 0.0001) and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio textgreater
  3 (p = 0.0007), were independently associated with the death of non-metastatic patients
  at follow-up. These findings highlight the importance of proactive, early management
  of malnutrition and cachexia in cancer patients, and in particular, in non-metastatic
  patients, from the perspective of a substantial improvement of their clinical outcomes.
