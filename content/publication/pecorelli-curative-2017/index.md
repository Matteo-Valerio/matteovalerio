abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer intermediate stage
  (BCLC-B) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes extremely heterogeneous patients
  in terms of tumour burden and liver function. Transarterial-chemoembolization (TACE)
  is the first-line treatment for these patients although it may be risky/useless
  for someone, while others could undergo curative treatments. This study assesses
  the treatment type performed in a large cohort of BCLC-B patients and its outcome.
  METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 485 consecutive BCLC-B patients from the ITA.LI.CA
  database diagnosed with naïve HCC after 1999. Patients were stratified by treatment.
  RESULTS: 29 patients (6%) were lost to follow-up before receiving treatment. Treatment
  distribution was: TACE (233, 51.1%), curative treatments (145 patients, 31.8%),
  sorafenib (18, 3.9%), other (39, 8.5%), best supportive care (BSC) (21, 4.6%). Median
  survival (95% CI) was 45 months (37.4-52.7) for curative treatments, 30 (24.7-35.3)
  for TACE, 14 (10.5-17.5) for sorafenib, 14 (5.2-22.7) for other treatments and 10
  (6.0-14.2) for BSC (Ptextless.0001). Independent prognosticators were gender and
  treatment. Curative treatments reduced mortality (HR 0.197, 95%CI: 0.098-0.395)
  more than TACE (HR 0.408, 95%CI: 0.211-0.789) (Ptextless.0001) as compared with
  BSC. Propensity score matching confirmed the superiority of curative therapies over
  TACE. CONCLUSIONS: In everyday practice TACE represents the first-line therapy in
  an half of patients with naïve BCLC-B HCC since treatment choice is driven not only
  by liver function and nodule characteristics, but also by contraindications to procedures,
  comorbidities, age and patient opinion. The treatment type is an independent prognostic
  factor in BCLC-B patients and curative options offer the best outcome.'
