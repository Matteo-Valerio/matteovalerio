abstract: 'BACKGROUND: In HCV-infected cirrhotic patients with successfully treated
  early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the time to HCC recurrence and the effects
  of sustained viral eradication (SVR) by interferon (IFN)-based or IFN-free regimens
  on HCC recurrence remain unclear. AIM: To perform an indirect comparison of time
  to recurrence (TTR) in patients with successfully treated early HCC and active HCV
  infection with those of patients with SVR by IFN-based and by IFN-free regimens.
  METHODS: We evaluated 443 patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and Barcelona Clinic
  Liver Cancer Stage A/0 HCC who had a complete radiological response after curative
  resection or ablation. Active HCV infection was present in 328, selected from the
  Italian Liver Cancer group cohort; 58 patients had SVR achieved by IFN-free regimens
  after HCC cure, and 57 patients had SVR achieved by IFN-based regimens after HCC
  cure. Individual data of patients in the last two groups were extracted from available
  publications. RESULTS: TTR by Kaplan-Meier curve was significantly lower in patients
  with active HCV infection compared with those with SVR both by IFN-free (P = 0.02)
  and by IFN-based (P textless 0.001) treatments. TTR was similar in patients with
  SVR by IFN-free or by IFN-based (P = 0.49) strategies. CONCLUSION: In HCV-infected,
  successfully treated patients with early HCC, SVR obtained by IFN-based or IFN-free
  regimens significantly reduce tumour recurrence without differences related to the
  anti-viral strategy used.'
