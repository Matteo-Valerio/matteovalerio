 abstract = {(1) Background: The identification of tumor subtypes is fundamental in precision medicine for accurate diagnoses and personalized therapies. Cancer development is often driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations that can cause alterations in tissue functions and morphologies. In this work, a method based on a deep neural network integrated into a network-based stratification framework (D3NS) is proposed to stratify tumors according to somatic mutations. (2) Methods: This approach leverages the power of deep neural networks to detect hidden information in the data by combining the knowledge contained in a network of gene interactions, as typical of network-based stratification methods. D3NS was applied using real-world data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for bladder, ovarian, and kidney cancers. (3) Results: This technique allows for the identification of tumor subtypes characterized by different survival rates and significant associations with several clinical outcomes (tumor stage, grade or response to therapy). (4) Conclusion: D3NS can provide a base model in cancer research and could be considered as a useful tool for tumor stratification, offering potential support in clinical settings.},
