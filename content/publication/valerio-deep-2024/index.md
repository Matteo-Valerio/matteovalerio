abstract: '(1) Background: The identification of tumor subtypes is fundamental in
  precision medicine for accurate diagnoses and personalized therapies. Cancer development
  is often driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations that can cause alterations
  in tissue functions and morphologies. In this work, a method based on a deep neural
  network integrated into a network-based stratification framework (D3NS) is proposed
  to stratify tumors according to somatic mutations. (2) Methods: This approach leverages
  the power of deep neural networks to detect hidden information in the data by combining
  the knowledge contained in a network of gene interactions, as typical of network-based
  stratification methods. D3NS was applied using real-world data from The Cancer Genome
  Atlas for bladder, ovarian, and kidney cancers. (3) Results: This technique allows
  for the identification of tumor subtypes characterized by different survival rates
  and significant associations with several clinical outcomes (tumor stage, grade
  or response to therapy). (4) Conclusion: D3NS can provide a base model in cancer
  research and could be considered as a useful tool for tumor stratification, offering
  potential support in clinical settings.'
