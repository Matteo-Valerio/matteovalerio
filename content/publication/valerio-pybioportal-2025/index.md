abstract: In recent years, the rise of big data and artificial intelligence has led
  to an increasing expansion of databases and web services in biomedical research.
  cBioPortal is one of the most widely used platforms for accessing cancer genomic
  and clinical data. The primary objective of this study was to develop a tool that
  simplifies programmatic interaction with cBioPortalâ€™s web service.We developed the
  pyBioPortal Python package, which leverages the cBioPortal REST API to access genomic
  and clinical data. The retrieved data is returned as a Pandas DataFrame, a format
  widely used for data analysis in Python.pyBioPortal offers an efficient interface
  between the user and the cBioPortal database. The data is provided in formats conducive
  to further analysis and visualization, promoting workflows and improving reproducibility.The
  development of pyBioPortal addresses the challenge of accessing and processing large
  volumes of biomedical data. By simplifying the interaction with the cBioPortal API
  and providing data in Pandas DataFrame format, pyBioPortal allows users to focus
  more on the analytical aspects rather than data extraction.This tool facilitates
  the retrieval of heterogeneous biological and clinical data in a standardized format,
  making it more accessible for analysis and enhancing the reproducibility of results
  in cancer informatics. Distributed as an open-source project, pyBioPortal is available
  to the broader bioinformatics community, promoting collaboration and advancing research
  in cancer genomics.The advent of big data and artificial intelligence has revolutionized
  cancer research, making large amounts of data available for analysis. However, accessing
  this data can be challenging, especially for researchers without specific programming
  skills or those who prefer to focus on data analysis and interpretation rather than
  on the technical aspects of data extraction. pyBioPortal is a newly developed Python
  tool designed to simplify the process of retrieving data from cBioPortal, a widely
  used platforms for accessing cancer genomic and clinical data. By making data easier
  to access and analyze, pyBioPortal enables researchers to focus on uncovering new
  insights that drive advancements in cancer research. The tool is freely available
  as an open-source project, promoting widespread use and collaboration within the
  bioinformatics community.
