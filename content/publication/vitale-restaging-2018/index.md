abstract: 'Prognostic assessment of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at
  the time of diagnosis remains controversial and becomes even more complex at the
  time of restaging when new variables need to be considered. The aim of the current
  study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of restaging patients before proceeding
  with additional therapies for HCC. Two independent Italian prospective databases
  were used to identify 1,196 (training cohort) and 648 (validation cohort) consecutive
  patients with HCC treated over the same study period (2008-2015) who had complete
  restaging before decisions about additional therapies. The performance of the Italian
  Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) prognostic score at restaging was compared with that of
  the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, Hong Kong Liver Cancer, and Cancer of the Liver
  Italian Program systems. A multivariable Cox survival analysis was performed to
  identify baseline, restaging, or dynamic variables that were able to improve the
  predictive performance of the prognostic systems. At restaging, 35.3% of patients
  maintained stable disease; most patients were either down-staged by treatment (27.2%)
  or had disease progression (37.5%). The ITA.LI.CA scoring system at restaging demonstrated
  the best prognostic performance in both the training and validation cohorts (c-index
  0.707 and 0.722, respectively) among all systems examined. On multivariable analysis,
  several variables improved the prognostic ability of the ITA.LI.CA score at restaging,
  including progressive disease after the first treatment, Model for End-Stage Liver
  Disease at restaging, and choice of nonsurgical treatment as additional therapy.
  A new ITA.LI.CA restaging model was created that demonstrated high discriminative
  power in both the training and validation cohorts (c-index 0.753 and 0.745, respectively).
  CONCLUSION: Although the ITA.LI.CA score demonstrated the best prognostic performance
  at restaging, other variables should be considered to improve the prognostic assessment
  of patients at the time of deciding additional therapies for HCC.'
